Welcome to my first Design Discussion. A series of posts where I will be looking at the designs surrounding various activities and games and evaluating these and discussing areas I recognise for improvement.

# Destiny 2 #

To start with lets talk about Destiny 2. Destiny 2 is a first person action MMO with a strong foundation built in its gunplay and worlds that it has built. Destiny 2 is a wide reaching game focusing mainly on PvE however does offer PvP modes. Destiny 2 is a live service game meaning it receives frequent updates usually around its yearly expansion releases & seasonal content with some small hotfixes and balance patches inbetween. A standard year for Destiny typically kicks off with an Expansion which is the largest content drop in the year, including a full campaign, at least 1 new planet, a raid and new activities and more.

### Beyond Light

Destiny 2: Beyond Light launched in November 2020. It featured the new planet, Europa and a returning destination in the Cosmodrome, returning from Destiny 1. It also featured a new raid based in the Deep Stone Crypt. Birthplace of the Exos a major race in Destiny 2 and constantly discussed in the background and lore books.
