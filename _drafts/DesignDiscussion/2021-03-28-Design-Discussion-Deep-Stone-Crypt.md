Welcome to my first Design Discussion. A series of posts where I will be looking at the designs surrounding various activities and games and evaluating these and discussing areas I recognise for improvement.

# Destiny 2 #

To start with lets talk about Destiny 2. Destiny 2 is a first person action MMO with a strong foundation built in its gunplay and worlds that it has built. Destiny 2 is a wide reaching game focusing mainly on PvE however does offer PvP modes. Destiny 2 is a live service game meaning it receives frequent updates usually around its yearly expansion releases & seasonal content with some small hotfixes and balance patches inbetween. A standard year for Destiny typically kicks off with an Expansion which is the largest content drop in the year, including a full campaign, at least 1 new planet, a raid and new activities and more.

### Beyond Light

Destiny 2: Beyond Light launched in November 2020. It featured the new planet, Europa and a returning destination in the Cosmodrome, returning from Destiny 1. It also featured a new raid based in the Deep Stone Crypt. Birthplace of the Exos a major race in Destiny 2 and constantly discussed in the background and lore books.

The Deep Stone Crypt opened on the 21st November 2020. The Destiny 2 community raced into the raid and immediately were faced with a small squad of forces. Upon defeating these the door forward opened and players were able to race through a small tunnel till they came to a door which acted as a sort of airlock. Upon moving through the airlock they walk into a heat bubble with a blizard raging outside. Players are greeted with a buff of "Sheltered from the Storm". Upon leaving the heat bubble, they start gaining stacks of Frostbite and after a short drive outside the heat bubble, they can see the next heat bubble. Players keep moving to each heat bubble navigating various different terrain with dangerous jumps and sheer drops. Players have to fight off a squad of enemies at each heat bubble as they progress through the hazardous terrain.

Bungie <a href="www.https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50141"> released a deep dive into the development of the Deep Stone Crypt </a>. In this deep dive they shared some of their insights into the development. In this deep dive they talked about how they had imagined "a high-speed Sparrow sprint across the snowy plains of europa". However this idea was only a foundation and needed some extra layers on top of it. The idea they decided on was the safe spots. But what other ideas could have been used?

One idea I can initially think of is having to navigate a much more rocky terrain where instead the terrain provides this cover. This could provide cover in various directions and instead have more randomised
