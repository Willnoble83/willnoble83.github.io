This project was work carried out for my university module 'Graphics 2'. I was tasked with creating a 3D render of a landscape along with rendering individual models. This utilised DirectX11 as well as C++. I created a node graph system to allow me to add individual elements to the world graph and create node trees to handle transform updates.

The landscape is created from interpreting information from a heightmap and utilising this information to create a grid of polygons which are filled in. Unfortunately, during the scope of this project lighting and texturing was not implemented in time.
