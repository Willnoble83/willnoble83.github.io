This design document is how I would design end game content surrounding the upcoming Lightfall Expansion & a season to accompany it. This concept is completely unofficial and is purely to show as an example of my game design thoughts. 

This design document will only cover the mechanics/systems side of the design as this is my main strength with prototyping and iteration. Art style will be discussed in a very minor way to paint some basic pictures but it will not be focused on.

This document is still a work in process however the document is available to download and read and will be updated as progress is made.

Sections:
New Enemy Race - The Veil (First Pass Completed).
New Raid - Twilight's Illumination (In Progress).
New Dungeon - TBD (Not Started).
New Weapon Concepts (Not Started).
New Armor Mods & Builds (Not Started).
