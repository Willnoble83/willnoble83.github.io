The unannounced project is a new project. I have started working on in YUnity. It is a project being worked on collaboratively with one other person who is helping with developing developer tooling.

Due to the nature of the project being very new a lot of details are still under deciding. However as a high-level overview, it is a top-down hack-n-slash roguelike with a focus on giving players meaningful decisions to change the story
of each playthrough.
