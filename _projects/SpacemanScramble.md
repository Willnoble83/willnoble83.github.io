Spaceman Scramble is a 3rd person Party Platformer game. Where players can place platforms, traps and all kinds of other items into the level before having to race to make it to the end. Players can play in four different levels with a general range of props and a unique set of props for each level. Each level also has its own unique mechanic and level features.

Spaceman Scramble is a multiplayer game being created as part of a multi-disicpline team including collaboration with other programmers and artists.

My role in Spaceman Scramble involved managing the programmers in the team as well as serving as the main creative director for the game. I have also contributed to the main game flow systems as well as assisting with any aspects that required special work to function in online multiplayer.

Spaceman Scramble is currently not available to be played by the public. However please reach out to me at willnoble1709@gmail.com if you wish to arrange a time to play the game and arrangements can be made.

Gameplay footage coming soon.
