Spaceman Scramble is a 3rd person Party Platformer game. Where players can place props including platforms, traps and more into the level before having to race to make it to the end. Players can play in four different levels with a general range of props and a unique set of props for each level. Each level also has its own unique mechanic and level features.

Spaceman Scramble is a multiplayer game being created as part of a multi-disicpline team including collaboration with other programmers and artists.

My role in Spaceman Scramble involved managing the programmers in the team as well as serving as the main creative director for the game. I have also contributed to various aspects of development from systems through to different props available in the game.

Spaceman Scramble is now available to the public! You can find the game on Itch.io here: https://shayyp.itch.io/spaceman-scramble. Please read the description as some extra setup is required to host a game.

There is currently a plan to develop Spaceman Scramble further however concrete plans of what will be updated are not yet to be confirmed.
