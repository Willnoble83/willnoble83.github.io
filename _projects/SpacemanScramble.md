Spaceman Scramble is a 3rd person Party Platformer game. Where players can place props including platforms, traps and more into the level before having to race to make it to the end. Players can play in four different levels with a general range of props and a unique set of props for each level. Each level also has its own unique mechanic and level features.

Spaceman Scramble is a multiplayer game that was created as part of a multi-disicpline team including collaboration with other programmers and artists.

# Areas I was responsible for
* Prop Placement System Iteration
* Python Backend Server (Lobby Management)
* Core Game Flow
* Multiplayer support for all game systems.
* Initial design of the 'Forest' level and full design of the 'Volcano' level.
* Assisted with prop design

## Deeper explanation of the role.
My role in Spaceman Scramble involved managing the programmers in the team as well as serving as the main creative director for the game. I have also contributed to various aspects of development from systems through to different props available in the game. My main focus for development was assisting in networked aspects of the game and fixing network glitches.

Spaceman Scramble has been taken offline. You can find the game on Itch.io here: https://shayyp.itch.io/spaceman-scramble. and has split-screen co-op. If you would like me to host a game for you to see what it is like in a networked session, please reach out to me at willnoble1709@gmail.com and this can be arranged.
