Whispers in the West is a multiplayer murder mystery game I worked on during my time at Infinite Whys. You can find more information on Whispers In the West here: https://whispersinthewest.infinite-y.com/

# Areas I was responsible for
## Highlights
* A complete rewrite of the dialogue system including system design, some gameplay designing and work on networking code.
* Refactoring legacy code
* Managing the build process for steam
* Seperating dev and production environments to better support testing.

## Deeper explanation of the role
At Infinite Whys, I work as a Game Developer utilising Unity. This project was my first time using Unity and I have had to learn and adapt to Unity while meeting deadlines and working on new systems. This has proven to be a great challenge however I have perservered and been able to carry out work such as being solely responsible for the design and implementation of a major game system.
