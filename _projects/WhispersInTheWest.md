* Refactoring legacy code

* Working with Unity Analytics to implement data gathering to facilitate decision makings for game design as well as tracking data for high-priority issues.

## Deeper explanation of the role
At Infinite Whys, I work as a Game Developer utilising Unity. This project was my first role utilising Unity and not only have I learnt to utilise Unity, I have been able to thrive and take on a higher level of responsibility then was expected. After starting out with a complete overhaul of a new dialogue system, I moved on to acting as the specialist on the team for networking related tasks. This has included being responsible for developing easy to use networked gameplay systems, adding in integration with back end services such as Google Cloud Storage and Unity Analytics as well as debugging network related issues. I have also been responsible for acting as a release manager for the team, setting out a process for builds, ensuring we have builds ready for public releases and QA sessions.
