Whispers in the West is a multiplayer murder mystery game I am working on while at Infinite Whys. You can find more information on Whispers In the West here: https://whispersinthewest.infinite-y.com/

# Areas I have been responsible for
* Sole developer designing and implementing the game's dialogue system
* Refactoring legacy code
* Build/Release management for QA testing and public release.
* Planning and leading implementation of improved structure of development environments to help improve development processes
* Working with Unity Analytics to implement data gathering to facilitate decision makings for game design as well as tracking data for high-priority issues.

## Deeper explanation of the role
At Infinite Whys, I work as a Game Developer utilising Unity. This project was my first role utilising Unity and not only have I learnt to utilise Unity, I have been able to thrive and take on a higher level of responsibility then is expected. After starting out with a complete overhaul of a new dialogue system, I moved on to acting as the specialist on the team for networking related tasks. This has included developing multiplayer enabled gameplay features, adding in integration with back end services such as Google Cloud Storage and Unity Analytic as well as debugging network related issues. Recently I have also taken on additional responsibility with acting as a release manager for the team, setting out a process for builds, ensuring we have builds ready for public releases and QA sessions.
