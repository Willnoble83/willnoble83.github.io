Wish of the Darkness is my raid design, intending to provide a true pinnacle challenge to Destiny 2. This raid design takes much more mechanics out of a typical MMO like World of Warcraft and attempts to apply them into a Destiny 2 raid.

Wish of the Darkness is based on the Last Wish Raid in Destiny 2 created by Bungie. It started out as a project to create an 'Extreme' difficulty of Last Wish. But as I moved on I started only being inspired by the original mechanics instead of trying to improve them. Thus I attempted to just go all in on putting my own spin on the raid.
