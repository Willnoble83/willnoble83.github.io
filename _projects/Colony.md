Colony is a colony management game I am working on. It will work in a full 3D space and offer players the challenge of trying to expand their colony and survive nature and other factions that are fighting for survival in the world.

Colony is currently being developed by me alone inside of Unreal Engine 4 primarily in C++. The sourcecode is publicly available to be viewed here: https://github.com/Willnoble83/Colony

The game is currently in very early development and in the future progress pictures and videos will be shared on my blog and also on my twitter ( https://twitter.com/WillNobleDev ) and linkedin ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-noble-2a9321202/ )
