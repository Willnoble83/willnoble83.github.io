A project where I am developing a 2D game engine that is utilising SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer).

The project is part of the work I am doing to further my understanding of C++ as well as gain a deeper understanding of how game engines work as I have identified this as a gap in my knowledge.

Currently, the engine is able to render 2D images to the screen utilising a node tree system. A player character has been setup taking inputs from the user as well as the ability to read world files and load worlds from xml files.

The source code is able to be viewed at the linked github repository.

# Media

# Areas I was responsible for
