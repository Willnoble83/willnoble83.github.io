title: Wish of the Darkness Design - First Version
---

As an update: I have now uploaded a raid design for a raid called "Wish of the Darkness" based off making a much harder difficulty of the Last Wish Raid in Destiny 2. It also features a boss that has mechanics of my original design. This boss is based off the Destiny villain 'Savathun'.
