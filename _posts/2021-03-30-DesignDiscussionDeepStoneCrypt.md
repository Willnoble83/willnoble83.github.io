Welcome to my first Design Discussion. A series of posts where I will be looking at the designs surrounding various activities and games and evaluating these and discussing areas I recognise for improvement. This will start with discussing the general raid and its introduction and then discussing each encounter's mechanics and then discussing various aspects of its design as well as some problems and how I would potentially fix these.

# Destiny 2 #

To start with lets talk about Destiny 2. Destiny 2 is a first person action MMO with a strong foundation built in its gunplay and worlds that it has built. Destiny 2 is a wide reaching game focusing mainly on PvE however does offer PvP modes. Destiny 2 is a live service game meaning it receives frequent updates usually around its yearly expansion releases & seasonal content with some small hotfixes and balance patches inbetween. A standard year for Destiny typically kicks off with an Expansion which is the largest content drop in the year, including a full campaign, at least 1 new planet, a raid and new activities and more.

### Beyond Light

Destiny 2: Beyond Light launched in November 2020. It featured the new planet, Europa and a returning destination in the Cosmodrome, returning from Destiny 1. It also featured a new raid based in the Deep Stone Crypt. Birthplace of the Exos a major race in Destiny 2 and constantly discussed in the background and lore books.

### Introduction


The Deep Stone Crypt opened on the 21st November 2020. The Destiny 2 community raced into the raid and immediately were faced with a small squad of forces. Upon defeating these the door forward opened and players were able to race through a small tunnel till they came to a door which acted as a sort of airlock. Upon moving through the airlock they walk into a heat bubble with a blizard raging outside. Players are greeted with a buff of "Sheltered from the Storm". Upon leaving the heat bubble, they start gaining stacks of Frostbite and after a short drive outside the heat bubble, they can see the next heat bubble. Players keep moving to each heat bubble navigating various different terrain with dangerous jumps and sheer drops. Players have to fight off a squad of enemies at each heat bubble as they progress through the hazardous terrain.


### The challenge for players

Bungie <a href="www.https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50141"> released a deep dive into the development of the Deep Stone Crypt </a>. In this deep dive they shared some of their insights into the development. In this deep dive they talked about how they had imagined "a high-speed Sparrow sprint across the snowy plains of europa". However this idea was only a foundation and needed some extra layers on top of it. The idea they decided on was the safe spots. Safe spots serve as a very clear path forward especially with the heat bubble visual Bungie gave to them. However there are some questions such as how are these supported and how have they not been noticed by others. This is a somewhat minor issue in the grand scheme of things. Ultimately, what other ideas are out there for this issue?

One idea I can  think of is having to navigate a much more rocky terrain where instead the terrain provides this cover. This could provide cover in various directions and instead have more randomised directions for the weather to make players feel like they have to constantly explore. This however would bring issues of this not being signposted clearly to the player which the heat bubble system does signpost very clearly. This would be an idea that could be improved upon but would require iteration with testing groups to ensure it meets the expectations of the typical player.

Overall I feel the heat bubble safe spot design is a very good idea and fits thematically quite well. Other ideas cause issues for the gameplay which is something that should be avoided. 

As players found their way to the final safe space. They moved into the exit airlock and made their way through the winding paths to what they were searching for... The Deep Stone Crypt.


# Deep Stone Crypt: Crypt Security #

### Encounter Introduction

Upon players entering the crypt, they make their way through the main entrance and through a side corridor. They enter through a door and are met with this room, Crypt Security. Immediately as players enter the room they can see a stark contrast between the room they are entering and a room they can enter through a door. One room is light, one room is dark. This is a very clear distinction that I feel was made to make it intuitive for players to make callouts that make sense with the raid mechanics. It also works as a nice callback to the constant theme of Light & Dark that has been present throughout Destiny. This is more prevalent recently where the guardian has been toying with the powers of darkness to use alongside the powers of the light. 


### Encounter Mechanics

The goal of this encounter is to obtain the Operator and Scanner buffs. The operator can interact with panels and the Scanner can see which panels are correct. A player cannot carry both buffs at once so teams must work to communicate this information with eachother. The scanner will be looking through glass panels in the floor to identify which panels are the correct ones to hit. The operator will head downstairs and hit all the panels in a fast timeframe to avoid burning alive. Upon all 4 panels being hit, the damage phase can start and the central fuses are exposed. However there is some buff switching that must happen. The operator now needs to obtain scanner but he cannot leave downstairs. The operator must deposit their buff in the terminal for someone else to pick up. Then the scanner must put their buff in the terminal for the person downstairs to pick up. Once the downstairs player has scanner, he can start calling out the correct fuses to shoot.

The new scanner will be able to see which fuse is glowing yellow and must call it out. These callouts are generally referred to as Light/Dark for which room they are in and then Left/Center/Right for which one to shoot. Players up top will shoot the fuse to break it. Then a new fuse will be shown as the correct one. Shooting the wrong fuse here will wipe the raid. Players have an amount of time that is dependent on how long they took to hit all the panels. At the end of the time the fuses will be protected and players will repeat this cycle. If players are fast enough they can shoot all 6 fuses and complete the encounter in one phase.

### Encounter Evaluation

So to start evaluating this encounter. First encounters in raids are usually quite underwhelming and are figured out quite quickly. However, this is one of the rate times that a first encounter has held players for quite a while (1hr30m-2hrs roughly). I think this encounter is quite well balanced in its difficulty of giving players a lot to figure out. Progression is noticeable through good sound design and gave key points in progression a good feeling. It also gave the encounter an extra layer during its damage phase with one player not able to contribute damage as they are calling out which fuses to shoot. 

This encounter definitely focuses more on its mechanics as the DPS required to complete this encounter is very low. For teams trying to progress this encounter, it is a much higher focus on executing mechanics accurately where DPS is not a barrier for raid teams to progress. This style of encounter however usually struggles with not allowing a sense of mastery to be achieved as players run the encounter more and more. This encounter cirumvents this by adding in a timer to how long a phase can generally run and only timegating when the cycle ends instead of timegating how long it takes to get to the damage phase or for key parts to happen. This also adds a slight DPS requirement if players wish to one phase the encounter as they must try to destroy all the fuses before they are protected which can be close if your team isn't fully prepared for damage.

Overall this encounter is a very solid first encounter and is one of the more impressive first encounters, as well as being the best puzzle encounter, we have seen in a destiny raid. However there is one issue where the player experience for completing the encounter is very underwhelming. It can leave players wondering if they did complete it or if there is more as the only signification that the encounter has ended is a power down sound, loot opening and door's opening. It feels like there should be another effect, such as all the light's powering down and plunging everyone into darkness before bringing back emergency lights or a flashing red alarm light.



# Deep Stone Crypt: Atraks-1 #

Players will leave the crypt security room and progress deeper into the crypt. They enter a room with doors locked and once all players enter a small interaction between Atraks-1 and the final boss Taniks happens. Taniks is revived and when he see's the players he tries to jump at them and break through the glass before leaving. This is a very good setup for the final boss and shows him early and his anger towards the players. Once this is finished, the encounter area opens for players to explore. They enter a large room that has some pod shutes at the end of the room. When the encounter starts, pods will come down and appear for players to use. When players use this, they are shot into space and arrive at the Morning Star, the Orbital Platform of the Deep Stone Crypt.

### Encounter Mechanics

The goal of this encounter is to ultimately, defeat Atraks-1. However there are many clones of him and a lot more happening then meets the eye. In this encounter there are two rooms, Ground & Space. There are clones of Atraks in both the ground & space room. The ground room will have the operator buff drop and the space room will have the scanner buff drop. There are terminals in both rooms so the space team usually will wait for the operator buff to drop so they can pick it up and head to the space room. Servitors will spawn in both rooms and these must be killed. The buff holding enemy spawns typically when the servitors spawn in their respective rooms. 

When all servitors are killed in both rooms, all the boss clones in the space room will start a wipe attack. The scanner will be able to see one glowing yellow and must call out which boss is glowing yellow. Players must attack it to intterupt the attack  after hitting a certain damage point. Players can continue damaging after this point to deal damage to Atraks-1. Intterupting the correct clone will intterupt all clones in the same room, intterupting the wrong clone will wipe the raid. Once this happens players must send the scanner buff to the ground room through the terminals as their clones will start a wipe attack. This repeats again for the space room and ground room after the first two. Then the first phase of shooting the servitors will start again.

When an Atraks-1 clone is destroyed, he will drop a debuff called Atraks-1 Replication with a 45s timer. If this timer expires the player holding the debuff will die and the clone of Atraks-1 will respawn in place and instantly wipe the raid. The operator can shoot the debuff off the player's head and it will reset the timer and drop it to the floor. This can then be picked up by anyone. To get rid of the debuff safely the player with the debuff and the operator must go to one of the airlocks. The operator can shoot the panel next to it to open the door. The debuff holder should walk inside the airlock and have the debuff shot off the head where it drops into the airlock. Then the player can leave and the airlock will slowly close. If this is done correctly the clone will respawn then immediately die before it can wipe the raid. These debuffs spawn for the ground room clones too so players must take a pod to the space room to have it ejected.

Players will repeat this till Atraks-1 is reduced to around 15% health. When this happens the operator must shoot all the pods that are upstairs to send them down so the ground team can come to the space platform. The clones in the ground room will teleport to the space room. Once everyone is present in the space room all the clones will start channeling a wipe attack. The scanner must call the correct clone to kill. This is repeated again almost immediately until the boss dies or the raid will wipe to the Atraks-1 Replication debuff.


### Encounter Evaluation

To kickstart the evaluation of this encounter. I want to start with saying this encounter is probably the most unique encounter that has existed inside a destiny raid. It breaks a somewhat consistent formula that has been present throughout destiny 2 of 'do something then damage with minimal things happening'. In this encounter, players are  having to almost consistently do damage in short burst phases while also juggling other mechanics. This encounter broke a trend among destiny raids where a boss has mechanics up until the damage phase where all threatening meDeepchanics end and its just shoot the boss. This encounter on day one of the raid releasing was everything a raid encounter should be, requriring optimised damage from players as well as quite heavy co-ordination to ensure debuffs are managed correctly. This encounter also broke the trend of the end boss usually being the main wall of a raid. Atraks-1 actually ended up being a bigger wall to most raid teams then Taniks as the final boss. To summarise: This encounter was a phenomenal day 1 experience and something as a destiny player I would personally love to see more of.

However, all good sides must have a downside and unfortunately, Atraks-1 post day one falls victim to a common issue destiny raids face of overlevelling causing the encounter to be much easier. This is also the partial fault of an exotic weapon that released after the raid's first completion. The Lament absolutely trivialises this boss and does insane damage which unfortunately means the replayability difficulty of this encounter is very low compared to how difficult it seemed on Day one. I do believe this is more a victim of the general sandbox design where being under levelled is slightly too punishing in terms of damage dealt where boss hp can't be increased anymore as players already push enrage during the first day. This is something I believe could be fixed with an adjustment to the under-power scaling to increase damage dealt to allow general enemy health to be increased in a proportionate fasion. This would nerf players increasing the difficulty of what it takes to easily kill a boss like this on repeat raids while also maintaining the day one difficulty.
