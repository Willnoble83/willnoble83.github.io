Hey there! I'm Will im a fresh graduate from the University of Derby's Computer Games Programming Course where I graduated with a First Class Honours award.

I am an aspiring Game Developer currently looking for a job in the games industry. I have a wide passion for a wide variety of games from casual to competitive games and have played at a wide variety of skill levels from low ranking to top 10%. Some of my achievements in gaming extend from top 30 in the University Overwatch Scene in the UK as a consistent team captain throughout my whole time at university as well as achieving Cutting Edge: N'zoth the Corruptor in the raid tier I started playing the game (Mythic 12/12 in World of Warcraft). This has granted me valuable insight into how games are developed and what can make a game feel good. Insight I strive to use at every chance I get. 

My games industry experience is small however I have made sure to make good use of every chance I have had. I have recently released a game as part of a cross discipline team called 'Spaceman Scramble' has been frequently praised by people who have given feedback during its development as something that could be quite big if development continued at its current pace. During these projects I have taken a lead and directing role as well as getting my hands dirty with the coding and design aspects. Collaborating with other developers to help features work smoothly in multiplayer and make features just feel good to play.

I setup this website to allow people to get an insight into how I work with programming and plan on expanding what is available on the site as time goes on. If you have any questions, offers or just want to discuss games, please reach out to me at willnoble1709@gmail.com. If you are interested, my CV is also available to download <a href="/assets/files/cv.pdf"> here </a>
